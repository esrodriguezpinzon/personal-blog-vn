Hi!

I'm Esteban Rodríguez Pinzón, Cloud solutions architect, usually guiding projects and teams to deliver a good solution. I keep focus on non-functional requirements like:

    - Scalability
    - Security
    - Delivery lifecycle
    - TDD
    - Availability
    - Monitoring
    - SRE

In terms of toolset I like a lot how GCP is taken Cloud although I have experience with AWS and AZURE.

List:
    Google Cloud Platform [GKE, GAE, GCE, VPC, APIGee, Pub/Sub, Dataflow, Bigquery, Cloud Build, Iot Core – Mqtt …] / AWS [EC2, S3, RDS, Iot …] / IaC [Terraform, Chef] / Jenkins / Circle CI / Kubernetes [Security, Service Mesh] / Nginx [Web server, proxy, load balancer] / Apache [Web server, beam] / Python [Scripting, Pandas, Flask, Django] / NodeJS [Express, Hapi] / SQL – NoSQL / Javascript.
